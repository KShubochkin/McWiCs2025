# **FRIDGE**
Welcome to FRIDGE.

FRIDGE is a program that helps people decide what to cook based on the items in their fridge. It stores the quantity of different ingredients a person has and uses it to find recipes that they are able to make. The aim of FRIDGE is to reduce food waste and help people develop cooking skills without splurging on unneeded ingredients.

## **How it Works**
FRIDGE has a set of standard ingredients that it keeps track of in a person's fridge: milk, eggs, chicken, etc. It then uses a dataset of recipes for various websites and parses to find those that the user has the ingredients for.
