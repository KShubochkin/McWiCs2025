# **FRIDGE**
What's for dinner tonight?

Welcome to FRIDGE. FRIDGE is a program that helps people decide what to cook based on the items in their fridge. It stores the quantity of ingredients a person has and uses it to find recipes they can make. FRIDGE aims to reduce food waste and help people develop cooking skills without splurging on unneeded ingredients.

## **How it Works**
FRIDGE maintains a repository of food users have. It then uses a dataset of recipes from various websites and parses the data to find recipes for which the user has the ingredients.
